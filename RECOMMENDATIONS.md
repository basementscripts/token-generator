# Recommendations for @basementscripts/token-generator

## 1. TypeScript Usage & Structure

- The codebase is well-structured, with clear separation between types, constants, and utility functions.
- TypeScript types and enums are used effectively for configuration and character sets.

## 2. Token Generation Logic

- The `generateToken` function is concise and leverages configuration for flexibility.
- Consider adding input validation (e.g., ensuring `length` is a positive integer, and `type` is valid).

## 3. Testing

- There are basic tests for token length, but consider adding more tests:
  - Test all character types (`Alpha`, `AlphaLower`, `Numeric`, etc.).
  - Test edge cases (e.g., zero/negative length, invalid type).
  - Test the `leadWithAlpha` option if implemented.

## 4. Documentation

- The `README.md` is clear and provides usage examples.
- Consider documenting all configuration options, including `pattern` and `leadWithAlpha`.

## 5. Code Quality

- The code is clean and readable.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names in some places (e.g., `pattern` vs. `injectedPattern`).

## 6. Build & CI

- The project uses GitHub Actions for CI, which is great.
- Node version is pinned to 14; consider supporting newer LTS versions.

## 7. Miscellaneous

- Consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md for open source contributions.
- Add badges for build status and npm version to the README.
